<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D22ctYLHH_5k7BY03kUHqBt13CfEBtzV/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Let's break down and interpret the graphs and information from **Round 1** for the **LOCK** brand:

### 1. **Sales, Production, and Inventory (in thousands of units)**

- **Units Sold**: **70.957K** units were sold during Period 1, which shows good demand for the product.
- **Production**: **55K** units were produced, which was below the number of units sold (70.957K). This might indicate that LOCK had strong demand but wasn't able to meet it with the amount produced.
- **Inventory**: **71K** units of inventory were left at the end of the period. This could suggest overproduction in the previous periods (before Period 1) or leftover units from earlier rounds. The significant inventory level might mean there was some misalignment between demand forecasting and production planning.

### 2. **Price and Competitor Price Evolution**

- **Current Recommended Retail Price for LOCK**: **$250**. This price was kept stable from Period 1, meaning the brand didn’t adjust its price.
  
- **Competitor Prices**: 
  - **SOLO** is at **$330**.
  - **MOST** is at **$270**.
  - **SOFT** is at **$210**.
  - **LOCK** is priced at **$250**.

  Compared to the competitors, LOCK is positioned mid-range:
  - **SOLO** has the highest price, which might mean it’s targeting a more premium market.
  - **SOFT** has the lowest price, indicating a budget or value segment.
  - **MOST** is slightly above LOCK, making it a closer competitor in terms of pricing.

  **LOCK’s pricing** is competitive but not premium. The **stable price** of $250 suggests that the brand may not have adapted to competitor pricing strategies.

### 3. **Unit Margin and Financial Metrics**
- **Recommended Retail Price**: **$250**.
- **Average Retail Price**: **$234**. This indicates that the actual price at which LOCK is being sold to consumers is slightly lower than the recommended price. Possible reasons for this could include discounts or promotions.
- **Average Distribution Margin**: **$78**. This refers to the margin earned by distributors, which seems healthy.
- **Average Selling Price**: **$156**. This is likely the amount the company receives per unit after accounting for costs, distributor margins, etc.
- **Estimated Unit Transfer Cost**: **$63**. This could be the cost involved in producing or transferring each unit to the distribution chain.
- **Unit Margin**: **$94**. This represents the profit per unit sold (after costs). It’s positive, suggesting LOCK is profitable per unit, but you may want to investigate if this can be improved by adjusting costs or the selling price.

### Key Takeaways from Period 1:

1. **Inventory Surplus**: Despite selling more units (70.957K) than what was produced (55K), a large inventory still exists. This means that previous overproduction or unmet demand forecasting could have occurred.

2. **Pricing**: LOCK is positioned as a mid-range brand. If the goal is to compete in a more premium market (closer to SOLO), pricing may need to be increased, or quality and features improved to justify a premium price.

3. **Unit Margin**: At $94, LOCK is making a healthy margin, but it's essential to balance this with demand. More could be done to optimize production so that it aligns better with actual sales.

Let's take a closer look at the possible reasons for **failure in the last round (Round 1)** and then focus on **improvements for Round 2**.

### 1. **Production Misalignment**
- In **Round 1**, you sold **70,957 units** of LOCK, but only planned to produce **58,000 units** for the next period.
- **Problem**: This production plan was too conservative compared to actual sales. You might face **inventory shortages**, which means missing out on potential sales in the next period.
- **Solution**: Increase the production plan to align more closely with expected demand. Given that you sold nearly 71,000 units in Round 1, planning to produce more than 70,000 units would prevent stockouts.

### 2. **Price Positioning**
- **Price for LOCK** was set at **$250**, while competitors like **SOLO and MOST** are priced higher.
- **Problem**: While LOCK is competitively priced, it might be perceived as a **budget or lower-quality** option compared to competitors. This price point might not be attractive enough to both high-value and quality-conscious consumers.
- **Solution**: Reevaluate the pricing strategy. If you want to continue focusing on value-conscious consumers, ensure your message and advertising emphasize **affordability**. However, if you're targeting more **premium segments**, consider increasing the price slightly and backing it up with improvements in product features or a stronger marketing campaign that highlights quality.

### 3. **Advertising Budget Allocation**
- In Round 1, your advertising budget was **$1,000K** for LOCK, with **$900K** in media and **$100K** in research. 
- The targeting was heavily focused on **Savers (45%)** and **Shoppers (30%)**, while **Profs** and **High Earners** received less attention.
- **Problem**: Over-reliance on the **price-sensitive market** (Savers and Shoppers) could have limited your brand's ability to reach more lucrative segments like **High Earners** or **Profs**. Also, the advertising spend could have been under-optimized if not enough was dedicated to research or improving the marketing message.
- **Solution**: Adjust the budget allocation to include **more advertising focus on High Earners and Profs**, as these segments might be more profitable. Also, consider increasing the **research budget** to better understand consumer preferences and improve marketing effectiveness.

### 4. **Targeting and Perceptual Objectives**
- In Round 1, you chose not to specify any **perceptual objectives**. This might have contributed to a less-focused brand image.
- **Problem**: Without clear objectives, your advertising may not have created a strong enough perception in the minds of the consumers. This could have led to your brand being lost in the noise among competitors who had a more targeted message.
- **Solution**: Define clear **perceptual objectives** for Round 2. For example, if you want LOCK to be seen as a **value-for-money option**, focus on affordability and reliability in your advertising. If you want to shift to a **premium positioning**, focus on quality and innovation.

### 5. **Competitor Dynamics**
- From the **competitor price evolution graph**, it's clear that **SOLO** and **MOST** are priced higher than LOCK, indicating they might be targeting more premium segments. These brands could be perceived as higher-quality, which might explain why you're not dominating the market.
- **Problem**: LOCK’s price point might not be competitive enough for a budget strategy or attractive enough for a premium market.
- **Solution**: Depending on your brand strategy, either reduce the price further and lean into the budget market or enhance the product/marketing and increase the price to target higher-end consumers.

### **Key Areas for Improvement in Round 2**

1. **Increase Production**: 
   - Plan to produce at least **70,000 units** or more to avoid stockouts and meet demand, especially since you sold nearly 71,000 units in Round 1.

2. **Refine Pricing Strategy**:
   - Reconsider the **$250 price point** for LOCK. If you stick with this price, make sure your advertising highlights affordability. Alternatively, consider raising the price slightly and emphasize premium features or quality.

3. **Adjust Advertising Strategy**:
   - Increase the **advertising budget** for **Profs** and **High Earners**. These are more lucrative segments that were under-targeted in Round 1.
   - Allocate a larger portion of the budget to **research** to better understand consumer needs and make more informed decisions.

4. **Set Clear Perceptual Objectives**:
   - Decide whether you want LOCK to be seen as an **affordable** or **premium** product and reflect that in both your advertising message and budget allocation.

5. **Better Targeting of Consumer Segments**:
   - If you want to focus on **Savers** and **Shoppers**, make sure to emphasize affordability and value in your message.
   - If you're shifting focus to more **high-value consumers (Profs, High Earners)**, increase your media and research budget for these segments, and adjust the product/price to match their expectations.

By adjusting these areas, you can position yourself better for **Round 2** and increase the chances of success!

These insights can be used to adjust production and pricing strategies in the next round to better align with demand and compete more effectively with the other brands.

I understand that you're aiming to improve and achieve better results in the second round. Let's focus on refining the strategy for **LOOP** to ensure it performs even better, considering your current standings and the market opportunities identified.

Here are key areas to optimize based on the 1st round results and your provided data:

### 1. **Production Strategy**:
   - **Current Situation**: In Round 1, you produced **109,000** units, but sold **112,163** units, which shows a clear shortfall in supply.
   - **Recommended Action**: 
     - **Increase production** to **120,000 units** as planned. However, based on competitor moves, consider increasing the production even more to capture unmet demand, potentially pushing production up to **125,000 units** if your budget allows.
     - This ensures you have enough inventory to meet market demand and cover unexpected growth.

### 2. **Pricing**:
   - **Current Price**: LOOP was priced at **$530**, competing directly with NOVA, priced at **$540**. In contrast, competitors like **ROCK** and **TONE** are priced lower.
   - **Market Insights**: The **High Earners** and **Profs** segments are responsive to premium pricing, but pricing could be a barrier for other growing segments like **Shoppers**.
   - **Recommended Action**:
     - **Maintain the price at $530** if you wish to continue targeting the high-end segment. However, to capture **Shoppers**—who are growing rapidly—consider a small price adjustment.
     - **Test a price reduction** to around **$520** to make LOOP more attractive without drastically cutting into margins. This might help LOOP appeal to a broader customer base without damaging its premium image.

### 3. **Advertising Strategy**:
   - **Current Situation**: You allocated **$3,000k** for advertising (split into **$2,550k media** and **$450k research**), but there was room to refine targeting. 
   - **Segment Growth**: For Round 2, **Shoppers** are expected to grow by **26.7%**—the highest growth rate among all segments—while **High Earners** and **Profs** remain significant but with slower growth rates.
   - **Recommended Action**:
     - **Increase focus on Shoppers**: Shift more of your advertising budget to the **Shoppers** segment, given their growth potential.
     - **Refined allocation**:
       - **High Earners**: 35% (down from 40%)
       - **Profs**: 30% (down from 35%)
       - **Shoppers**: 25% (up from 15%)
       - **Explorers**: 5%
       - **Savers**: 5%
     - This shift better aligns LOOP with the expanding **Shoppers** segment while still focusing on premium customers.

### 4. **Market Research**:
   - **Current Situation**: You did not purchase additional market studies in Round 1. Not having this data might have left gaps in understanding how your competitors or consumers are behaving in different market segments.
   - **Recommended Action**:
     - **Purchase market studies** such as **Semantic Scales** or **Multidimensional Scaling** to gain insights into customer preferences and competitor positioning. This data will help refine messaging and better position LOOP in the market.
     - Additionally, investing in a **Competitive Advertising Estimate** could give you insights into your competitors' media strategies, allowing you to make informed decisions.

### 5. **Targeting and Perceptual Objectives**:
   - **Current Situation**: No perceptual objectives were defined in Round 1, which means you may not have leveraged your advertising budget to influence consumer perceptions directly.
   - **Recommended Action**:
     - Define **perceptual objectives** to better position LOOP in customers' minds. This will help differentiate LOOP from competitors like NOVA and ROCK, especially in the growing **Shoppers** segment. 
     - Focus on perceptual attributes like **innovation**, **quality**, and **value for money**. Using **Semantic Scales** or **Multidimensional Scaling** can help identify the most relevant attributes for LOOP’s target audience.

### Summary of Optimized Strategy for LOOP in Round 2:

1. **Production**: 
   - Increase production to **125,000 units** to ensure enough supply for increasing demand.
2. **Pricing**: 
   - Consider reducing the price to **$520** to capture more **Shoppers**, while maintaining a strong appeal to **High Earners** and **Profs**.
3. **Advertising**:
   - Increase focus on **Shoppers** due to their high growth rate:
     - **High Earners**: 35%
     - **Profs**: 30%
     - **Shoppers**: 25% (increase)
     - **Explorers**: 5%
     - **Savers**: 5%
4. **Market Research**:
   - Invest in **Semantic Scales** or **Multidimensional Scaling** to better understand how to position LOOP effectively.
   - Consider purchasing **Competitive Advertising Estimates** to gain insights into competitor strategies.
5. **Perceptual Objectives**:
   - Set perceptual objectives focused on **innovation**, **quality**, and **value for money** to enhance LOOP’s positioning.

By making these adjustments, LOOP can capture more of the market’s growth potential, particularly by aligning with the fast-growing **Shoppers** segment and optimizing production to meet demand.

To secure victory in Round 2, it is essential to address the shortcomings from Round 1 and implement a strategy that capitalizes on market opportunities. Below is a comprehensive strategy tailored to ensure success, focusing on each aspect of the decision-making process:

### 1. **Target Consumer Segments**
First, clearly define the target consumer segments. Given the data, **Savers** and **Shoppers** represent the largest market segments, so they should be the primary focus. Additionally, targeting **Prof** and **High Earners** as secondary segments can help balance the portfolio.

- **LOCK**: Focus on **Savers** as the primary target and **Shoppers** as a secondary target. Savers are price-sensitive, so the strategy should emphasize **affordable pricing** and **efficient production** to capture this segment.
- **LOOP**: Target **High Earners** and **Profs**, with **Shoppers** as a secondary target. This brand should follow a **premium pricing strategy** and leverage its **high-quality image** to attract affluent consumers.

### 2. **Pricing Strategy**
A key misstep in Round 1 was the pricing strategy. Setting the right price for each segment is crucial.

- **LOCK**: Consider a **5% price reduction** to enhance competitiveness. Since Savers are price-sensitive, a slightly lower price compared to competitors can increase market share and appeal to cost-conscious consumers.
- **LOOP**: Maintain a **premium pricing** approach while emphasizing the brand’s exclusivity and quality. The price can either remain the same or be **reduced by 1-2%** to stay competitive, ensuring that it aligns with the preferences of High Earners and Profs.

### 3. **Production Adjustment**
To avoid issues with inventory or underproduction from Round 1, the production levels should be fine-tuned based on projected demand.

- **LOCK**: **Increase production by 10-15%** to meet the expected higher demand from Savers and Shoppers as prices decrease. Ensuring enough stock is critical to maintaining sales momentum.
- **LOOP**: **Maintain or slightly increase production (5-10%)**. High Earners and Profs are more stable markets, and any production increase should match demand from these affluent customers.

### 4. **Advertising and R&D Budget Allocation**
Allocating the advertising and research budget to maximize impact across target segments is essential.

- **LOCK**: Focus on cost-conscious consumers by allocating **$1,000K–1,200K to Media** and **$100K–200K to Research**, promoting the product’s efficiency and reliability. This will resonate well with the Savers and Shoppers segments.
- **LOOP**: Allocate **at least $2,500K to Media** and **$400K–500K to Research** to strengthen its premium brand positioning. Emphasize innovation, luxury, and product superiority to attract High Earners and Profs.

### 5. **Commercial Team Allocation and Distribution Channel Strategy**
Effectively distributing the commercial team across sales channels ensures maximum reach and sales conversion.

- **LOCK**: Focus on **Mass Merch (50%)** and **Specialty Stores (40%)**, with **Online Stores (10%)**. The emphasis should be on Mass Merch, where Savers are more likely to shop.
- **LOOP**: Prioritize **Online Stores (40%)** and **Specialty Stores (40%)**, with **Mass Merch (20%)**. Affluent consumers (High Earners and Profs) are more likely to shop online or in specialty stores, so focus the team’s efforts there.

### 6. **R&D and Product Improvement**
Post-Round 2, you will have access to R&D. Investing in R&D to enhance product features and maintain a competitive edge is essential.

- **LOCK**: Invest in R&D to **improve cost efficiency** and reduce maintenance costs, catering to the needs of price-sensitive Savers and ensuring long-term market dominance.
- **LOOP**: Focus on **premium features** through R&D, such as longer battery life or faster performance, which will appeal to High Earners and Profs. Enhancing technological superiority will reinforce the brand's premium positioning.

### 7. **Targeted Advertising Messaging**
Create targeted advertising campaigns with tailored messages for each consumer segment.

- **LOCK**: For **Savers**, emphasize “best value for money” and “efficiency.” For **Shoppers**, highlight the “affordable price with superior performance.”
- **LOOP**: For **High Earners** and **Profs**, focus on the “premium quality and cutting-edge technology.” For **Shoppers**, emphasize the “smart investment in a high-quality product.”

### Summary of the Strategy:
- **LOCK**: Slightly reduce pricing, focus on increasing production, and target Savers and Shoppers. Invest in Mass Merch and Specialty Stores, emphasizing cost-efficiency and reliability in advertising.
- **LOOP**: Maintain a premium pricing strategy, target High Earners and Profs, and increase advertising to strengthen the luxury and innovation image. Focus on Online Stores and Specialty Stores for distribution.

By implementing this strategy, you can effectively target key consumer segments, optimize pricing and production, and allocate resources strategically to outperform competitors in Round 2.

## Commercial Team Decisions

In this section of the **Commercial Team Decisions**, there could be several factors contributing to suboptimal performance in the previous round. Here's a detailed breakdown of possible issues and how they might have impacted the overall performance:

### Potential Errors in Commercial Team Allocation:

1. **Imbalance in Channel Allocation**:
   - **LOOP** had more commercial team members allocated to **Specialty Stores** (14) compared to **Mass Merchandisers** (10), but based on the **Shopping Habits chart**, only **45% of Shoppers** (a key target segment) prefer Specialty Stores, whereas **43%** prefer Mass Merchandisers.
   - This suggests that there might have been an over-allocation to Specialty Stores and under-allocation to Mass Merchandisers, especially considering that **Shoppers** represent a growing segment and are more likely to shop at Mass Merchandisers.

2. **Potential Over-reliance on Specialty Stores**:
   - Specialty Stores were allocated **24** team members (total), matching Mass Merchandisers, but looking at the Shopping Habits chart, **Savers** (a key target group for LOOP) favor **Mass Merchandisers** (60%) and **Specialty Stores** (30%). 
   - **High Earners** also favor Mass Merchandisers more (50%) compared to Online Stores (33%). This indicates that your allocation could have better targeted **Mass Merchandisers**, which serve a broader audience.

3. **Low Allocation to Online Stores**:
   - Both LOCK and LOOP had only **6 team members** each allocated to Online Stores, yet **Online Stores** account for **18%** of the High Earners' shopping preference, **20%** for Shoppers, and **20%** for Profs.
   - Since **High Earners** are a significant target for LOOP, increasing presence in Online Stores could have captured more of this segment. Your allocation to Online Stores seems too low compared to the growing importance of this channel for several key consumer segments.

### Recommended Adjustments for Round 2:

1. **Increase Team Allocation to Mass Merchandisers**:
   - Since **Shoppers** and **Savers** (both critical segments) prefer Mass Merchandisers, increase the allocation here for both LOCK and LOOP. For LOOP, increase allocation from **10 to 14** to match the importance of this channel.

2. **Increase Focus on Online Stores**:
   - Consider increasing allocation to **Online Stores** from **6 to 8 or 9** for LOOP, to better align with the shopping habits of **High Earners** and **Profs**, who show a significant preference for this channel.
   
3. **Balanced Specialty Store Allocation**:
   - Since **Explorers** and **Shoppers** still value Specialty Stores, keeping a strong presence there is essential. For LOOP, reduce the allocation slightly from **14 to 12** to free up resources for other channels while maintaining a good presence.

### New Allocation Example for LOOP:
- **Specialty Stores**: 12 team members (down from 14)
- **Mass Merch**: 14 team members (up from 10)
- **Online Stores**: 8 team members (up from 6)

This adjustment better reflects the actual shopping habits and channel preferences of key customer segments, especially focusing on the growing **Shoppers** and high-value **High Earners** segments.

## Market Research Studies



The **Market Research Studies** section allows you to purchase detailed market insights, which can provide a critical competitive edge by understanding consumer behavior, competitors, and market dynamics. In the first round, some studies were not purchased, which might have resulted in missed opportunities for precise decision-making.

### Issues and Missed Opportunities in the First Round:

1. **Lack of Detailed Competitor Insights**:
   - **Competitive Advertising** and **Competitive Commercial Team** studies were not purchased. These could have provided valuable information about your competitors' advertising spend and the size of their sales teams. Without these insights, your allocation and marketing strategies were made without a clear understanding of your competitors' actions, which may have led to suboptimal decisions in positioning and spending.

2. **Missed Market Preferences**:
   - The **Multidimensional Scaling** study was not purchased. This study helps understand brand similarities and preferences in the eyes of the consumers. Without this, your brand's positioning in the market may not have been fully optimized, making it difficult to align your product with consumer preferences.

3. **Lack of Product-Specific Research**:
   - **Conjoint Analysis** and **Advertising Experiment** were not purchased. **Conjoint Analysis** helps you understand what product features are most valued by customers, while the **Advertising Experiment** could have provided insight into which advertising messages resonate best. By not investing in these studies, you may have missed opportunities to fine-tune your product features and marketing messages to maximize appeal to target segments.

### Recommended Purchases for Round 2:

To make better decisions and improve your strategy for the second round, you should invest in key research studies. Here's what I recommend:

1. **Competitive Advertising** ($31,750):
   - This study will give you insights into how much your competitors are spending on advertising and in which channels. You can then adjust your advertising budget accordingly to match or outpace competitors in the most important segments or channels.

2. **Competitive Commercial Team** ($16,000):
   - Understanding the size and allocation of your competitors' commercial teams can help you optimize your own commercial team allocation. If you know that a competitor is heavily focused on Online Stores or Mass Merchandisers, for instance, you can adjust your own team to ensure you are not losing ground in those channels.

3. **Multidimensional Scaling** ($37,250):
   - This study will help you understand how consumers perceive your brand compared to competitors. This can help you adjust your product's positioning in the market, ensuring that you stand out in areas that matter most to your target segments.

4. **Conjoint Analysis** ($37,250):
   - This analysis can reveal which product features are most important to different consumer segments. This is particularly valuable if you are considering launching a new brand or modifying an existing one, as it will guide the development process to meet consumer needs more precisely.

5. **Advertising Experiment** ($26,500):
   - By running an experiment, you can determine which advertising messages or channels work best. This will allow you to optimize your media and research spending in Round 2 and beyond, ensuring that your message reaches the right people in the most effective way.

### Summary of Recommended Purchases:
- **Competitive Advertising**: $31,750
- **Competitive Commercial Team**: $16,000
- **Multidimensional Scaling**: $37,250
- **Conjoint Analysis**: $37,250
- **Advertising Experiment**: $26,500

Total Investment in Market Research: **$148,750**

### Why This Strategy Works:
- By purchasing these studies, you can make **data-driven decisions** that allow you to:
  - Optimize advertising spend based on competitor insights and experiment results.
  - Adjust your commercial team allocation to better compete in key channels.
  - Fine-tune your product offerings and positioning based on actual consumer preferences.
  - Understand and outmaneuver your competitors, ensuring your strategies are not based on guesswork but on **solid market intelligence**.

By using this research, you can **improve both production and marketing strategies**, aligning your efforts with market demands, competitor movements, and consumer expectations, increasing your chances of success in Round 2.
