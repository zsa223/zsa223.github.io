# Round 05



## Feedback from your Coach – Firm Lynx – Period 4

You will find below a few feedback messages that have been generated by the simulation based on your firm situation.

This feedback starts with a section on your firm and continues with a section for each of your brands. The feedback messages focus mainly on your weaknesses and issues rather than on your strengths or successes. Some messages are more important than others and some messages can simply be ignored.

The simulation may hide some numbers in case you did not purchase some market studies; so do not be surprised if you see a few ‘XX’ in your messages.

The feedback messages are a nice complement to your own analysis, but certainly not a substitute. Make sure to spend a good part of your decision time to review your report and your market studies.

### Firm Lynx

- Your overall performance is fair. Your firm Lynx is ranked: #5 in share price index: #5 in volume market share; #5 in value market share; and #5 in net contribution.
- Your revenues have decreased by -22.3%. Please review your brand-level feedback so as to understand where this situation may come from.
- Most of your contribution after marketing is generated by LOOP (83% ). This is a high-risk situation in case competition becomes stronger in LOOP's market. It would be wise to reinforce your other brands or to launch new ones.
- Your budget for the next period is 8.0 million dollars. This is one of the lowest in the industry. Budgets for the next period range from 8.0 to 23.0 million dollars.

### Brand LOCK

- The feedback below is based on the assumption that LOCK is primarily targeted at segment Savers. Ignore this feedback if this is not the case.
- Savers are ranked #3 in terms of value retail sales ($182 mio). This segment is very attractive in terms of future growth (XX%).
- LOCK is ranked #3 in Savers with a share of 8.0%U.This share has decreased over the past period by 2.2%U. The key competitors in this segment are: NOON, SOFT, LOCK
- The contribution after marketing of LOCK is below average. Read the detailed feedback below and try to increase the performance of this brand.
- LOCK is not very well perceived by Savers along the product dimensions of the Brand Maps and Perceptual Maps (if available), and its physical characteristics do not fit Savers expectations. You need to initiate an R+D project on LOCK to improve its characteristics. The semantic scales study suggests that you focus on Design, Proc. Power.
- Your production plan was slightly too high (60k units). Despite the automated reduced production (48k units), your final inventory is 18k units.
- 49% of Savers are aware of LOCK.This awareness level is low compared to other offerings targeted at Savers.
- You have not set any perceptual objectives for LOCK this period. Setting perceptual objectives allows you to better position your offering and thus better target Savers.
- The market share of LOCK is significantly lower than its purchase intentions, especially amongst Savers (8.0% versus 11.2%). This is usually due to production and/or distribution issues. In the case of LOCK, distribution seems to be the source of the problem.

### Brand LOOP

- The feedback below is based on the assumption that LOOP is primarily targeted at segment High Earners. Ignore this feedback if this is not the case.
- High Earners are ranked #4 in terms of value retail sales ($171 mio). This segment is slightly attractive in terms of future growth (XX%).
- LOOP is ranked #5 in High Earners with a share of 9.2%U.This share has decreased over the past period by 0.4%U. The key competitors in this segment are: NOVA, MODUS, ROCK, TONE
- The contribution after marketing of LOOP is average. Read the detailed feedback below and try to further increase the performance of this brand.
- LOOP is not very well perceived by High Earners along the product dimensions of the Brand Maps and Perceptual Maps (if available), and its physical characteristics do not fit High Earners expectations. You need to initiate an R+D project on LOOP to improve its characteristics. The semantic scales study suggests that you focus on Design, Proc. Power, Display, Battery.
- The production plan set for LOOP was too high (160k units). 128k units were produced and your inventory is now 55k units.
- 77% of High Earners are aware of LOOP.This is one of the highest awareness levels amongst offerings targeted at High Earners.
- You have not set any perceptual objectives for LOOP this period. Setting perceptual objectives allows you to better position your offering and thus better target High Earners.

The setup for the LOOP2 project appears well-aligned with the goal of targeting budget-conscious consumers. Here’s why it seems suitable:

1. **Features**: Set to 9, offering moderate functionality that aligns with an economy product.
2. **Design**: With a design index of 7, it provides a satisfactory level of aesthetics for budget users.
3. **Battery**: The 45-hour battery life offers ample usage time, making the product competitive for value-focused consumers.
4. **Display**: The 6-inch screen size is appropriate and likely meets the needs of the target market.
5. **Processing Power**: At 13 GFLOPS, the processing power provides efficient performance at a reasonable cost, suitable for a budget product.

### Budget Allocation
- **Budget Allocated this Period**: Set at 740 K$, this amount seems appropriate for developing an economy-focused product, neither too low nor excessively high.

This setup aligns well with the feedback and the strategy for catering to the budget-conscious segment. You can proceed by running an "Online Query" to confirm that the budget is accurately estimated. Once confirmed, click "Create" to start the project.

To optimize the **Commercial Team Allocation** for LOCK and LOOP based on the feedback and **consumer shopping habits**, here’s a strategic recommendation:

### Current Situation Analysis:
1. **LOCK**:
   - Specialty Stores: 9 people
   - Mass Merchandising: 20 people
   - Online Stores: 5 people
   - Total Team: 34 people

2. **LOOP**:
   - Specialty Stores: 30 people
   - Mass Merchandising: 15 people
   - Online Stores: 11 people
   - Total Team: 56 people

3. **Consumer Shopping Habits**:
   - **Savers** (primary target for LOCK) shop mostly in Mass Merchandising (62%) and Specialty Stores (23%), with a relatively lower presence in Online Stores (15%).
   - **Shoppers** favor Specialty Stores (40%) and Mass Merchandising (42%), with lower preference for Online Stores (18%).
   - Other segments, such as Profs and High Earners, prefer Mass Merchandising and Online Stores, while Explorers have a strong preference for Specialty Stores.

### Adjustment Strategy Based on Feedback:
- **LOCK** should focus on **increasing the team allocation in Mass Merchandising**, as Savers are price-sensitive and typically look for deals in this channel, which suits LOCK’s positioning.
- **LOOP**, catering to Shoppers and Explorers, should maintain a strong presence in Specialty Stores while also considering a balanced allocation in Mass Merchandising to reflect consumer preferences.

### Recommended Commercial Team Allocation Strategy:
1. **LOCK**:
   - **Specialty Stores**: 8 people (reduce by 1)
   - **Mass Merchandising**: 22 people (increase by 2)
   - **Online Stores**: 4 people (reduce by 1)
   - **Total Team**: 34 people (no change)
   - **Rationale**: Since LOCK’s target segment (Savers) frequently shops in Mass Merchandising, increasing the team here would enhance exposure, while reducing focus slightly in Online Stores.

2. **LOOP**:
   - **Specialty Stores**: 28 people (reduce by 2)
   - **Mass Merchandising**: 16 people (increase by 1)
   - **Online Stores**: 12 people (increase by 1)
   - **Total Team**: 56 people (no change)
   - **Rationale**: While LOOP’s target segments prefer Specialty Stores, a slight increase in Mass Merchandising and Online Stores better aligns with the shopping habits of Shoppers and Explorers, ensuring broader accessibility.

This adjustment should help LOCK focus on Mass Merchandising to reach its primary consumer base, while LOOP’s allocation better balances presence across relevant channels to maximize impact for its target audience.

Based on the feedback from the provided PDF file, here’s an analysis of the settings you've applied for the brand **LOCK** in the latest configuration. I’ll evaluate each section and confirm if the settings align with the feedback suggestions or if any further adjustments are needed.

---

### 1. **Production**

   - **Current Setting**: 65,000 Units.
   - **Feedback Check**: 
     - The feedback recommends ensuring adequate production based on prior sales data and inventory to avoid a shortage. Given that **62,290** units were sold last period and **18,238** units remain in inventory, setting production at **65,000** units should adequately meet potential demand without excessive surplus.

   - **Current Setting**: $240 (unchanged from the last period).
   - **Feedback Check**:
     - The feedback suggests that if the competitor pricing is stable or slightly higher, maintaining or slightly increasing the price could support the brand positioning. Based on the competitor price evolution, where prices have ranged around **$305 - $319**, keeping the price at **$240** could help in positioning LOCK as a more affordable choice.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. Keeping the price at $240 appears appropriate for the current competitive environment.

   - **Current Setting**:
     - Media: $2,042k

     - Profs: 0%
     - High Earners: 0%
     - Savers: 75%

### 5. **Perceptual Objectives**

   - **Current Setting**:

   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. The selected dimensions and levels reflect appropriate positioning.

---

### Summary

Based on the settings for **LOOP** and the feedback you received, here’s a detailed evaluation to ensure alignment with the coach's suggestions. I’ll analyze each section and indicate if any further adjustments are necessary.

---

### 1. **Production**

   - **Current Setting**: 120,000 Units.
   - **Feedback Check**: 
     - Given that **90,754** units were sold last period and **55,048** units remain in inventory, setting production at **120,000** units appears to be a cautious approach to meet anticipated demand. The feedback likely suggested ensuring ample inventory to avoid stockouts.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. The production level should provide sufficient stock without creating excessive surplus.

### 2. **Price**

   - **Current Setting**: $530 (reduced from $540 in the previous period).
   - **Feedback Check**:
     - The feedback may have suggested reviewing competitor prices and adjusting accordingly to remain competitive. Since **competitor prices** are around the $480 - $560 range, setting LOOP’s price to **$530** positions it slightly above the average, appealing to higher-end segments without significantly undercutting.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. The price adjustment should help maintain competitiveness while targeting certain consumer segments effectively.

     - Media: $2,350k
     - Research: $650k
   - **Feedback Check**:
     - The feedback likely emphasized investing adequately in **advertising** to improve brand awareness and utilizing **research** to understand and reach target segments more effectively. The **total advertising budget** of **$3,000k** shows a balanced investment in both media and research.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. This allocation supports brand visibility and informed consumer targeting.

### 4. **Budget Allocation Across Consumer Segments**

   - **Current Allocation**:
     - Explorers: 0%
     - Shoppers: 10%
     - Profs: 60%
     - High Earners: 30%
     - Savers: 0%
   - **Feedback Check**:
     - The feedback may have recommended focusing on **Profs** and **High Earners** to position LOOP as a premium product, as these segments are less price-sensitive and value higher specifications.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. The allocation reflects an intentional focus on Profs and High Earners, which is in line with a premium positioning strategy.

### 5. **Perceptual Objectives**

   - **Current Setting**: 
     - **Dimension 1**: Design (Objective level 4).
     - **Dimension 2**: Processing Power (Objective level 4).
   - **Feedback Check**:
     - If the feedback recommended improving **Design** and **Processing Power** to appeal to Profs and High Earners, this setting aligns well with positioning LOOP as a durable and efficient product for professionals and high earners.
   - **Verdict**: Aligned with feedback. These perceptual objectives strengthen LOOP’s appeal to the target segments by focusing on features they prioritize.

---

### Summary

The current settings for the brand LOOP are well-aligned with the feedback. Production, pricing, advertising, consumer segment budget allocation, and perceptual objectives all reflect a clear strategy aimed at attracting and meeting the expectations of **Profs** and **High Earners**. These settings position LOOP as a high-end product within the Sonites market, catering to a segment that values design and processing power.
