# Round 03



---

## (Review) Round 2

We will review the decisions made in Round 2 and analyze what went wrong and what successes we achieved in each area.

### Achievements
1. **High Brand Awareness of LOOP**
   - The LOOP brand has a **79%** high awareness in the **High Earners** segment. This indicates that LOOP is a well-recognized brand in this segment, suggesting that our advertising strategy was somewhat effective.
   - LOOP sold **115,995 units**, contributing **84%** to the company's total revenue. This establishes LOOP as the core brand driving sales.

2. **Appropriate Production Planning for LOCK**
   - LOCK produced **87,000 units** with no remaining inventory, indicating effective production planning from an inventory management perspective. This likely had a positive impact on cost management.

3. **Overall Marketing Expense Management**
   - Out of a total marketing budget of $8.3M, **$6.0M** was utilized effectively. Advertising and commercial team expenses were appropriately allocated.

### Mistakes and Areas for Improvement
1. **LOW Market Share in the Savers Segment for LOCK**
   - LOCK achieved a **13.6%** market share in the **Savers** segment, a **2.2%** decrease compared to the previous period. LOCK fell behind key competitors such as **SOFT, NOON, MOST, SOLO**, failing to meet the expectations of the Savers segment.
   - Feedback indicated that in the Savers segment, **Design** and **Proc. Power** did not meet expectations, making the product features incompatible with their needs.

2. **Low Awareness of LOCK and Commercial Team Allocation**
   - LOCK has a **39%** awareness rate, which is low compared to competing brands. Feedback pointed out that allocating too many resources (**8 people**) to **Online Stores** and relatively fewer (**7 people**) to **Specialty Stores** was problematic. Despite the Savers segment's tendency to purchase from Specialty Stores, the commercial team allocation did not reflect this, negatively impacting performance.

3. **Lack of R&D**
   - It was highlighted that no **R&D** was conducted in the past two years. Customer demands change over time, necessitating continuous product improvements, which was not addressed.
   - Specifically, **LOOP** failed to meet the requirements in **Design, Proc. Power, Display, Battery** aspects within the High Earners segment. These areas need improvement through R&D.

### Summary of Analysis
- **Achievements**: The LOOP brand demonstrated high awareness and contributed significantly to sales, while effective production planning resolved inventory issues.
- **Issues**: LOCK saw a decline in market share within the Savers segment, and product features did not meet expectations. Commercial team allocation was incorrect, and overall product improvement through R&D was insufficient.

### Improvement Directions
1. **Invest in R&D**: Both LOCK and LOOP have important product improvement needs in the Savers and High Earners segments. R&D should focus on **Design** and **Proc. Power**.
2. **Reallocate Commercial Teams**: Adjust LOCK’s commercial team allocation by assigning more personnel to **Specialty Stores** and reducing staff in **Online Stores**.
3. **Enhance Advertising**: Strengthen advertising efforts to increase LOCK’s low awareness. It is particularly important to increase advertising targeted at the Savers segment.

Through this analysis, we can clearly identify the mistakes and achievements in Round 2 and improve our strategies moving forward.

### Reasons for LOCK Brand's Low Market Share in the Savers Segment

The low market share of the LOCK brand in the Savers segment may be attributed to factors beyond just the allocation of the commercial team. According to the information provided in the screenshot, **80%** of the commercial team was assigned to the Savers segment. However, merely allocating the commercial team does not guarantee performance.

#### Additional Issues to Consider:

**1. Mismatch of Product Characteristics:**

The Savers segment assessed that the LOCK brand's design and **Processor Power (Proc. Power)** did not meet their expectations. This implies that even with a substantial commercial team, if the product itself fails to satisfy consumer expectations, driving sales becomes challenging.

**2. Brand Awareness Issues:**

LOCK's brand awareness stands at **39%**, which is relatively low compared to competing brands. High personnel allocation alone may have limited impact on sales if brand awareness remains low.

**3. Strength of Competing Brands:**

There are strong competitors in the Savers segment such as **SOFT, NOON, MOST, SOLO**. These brands likely offer superior product features or possess higher brand awareness than LOCK, making it difficult for LOCK to compete effectively.

**4. Insufficient Advertising Impact:**

Even with a significant advertising budget, an effective advertising strategy tailored to the target segment is essential. It is necessary to analyze the purchase decision process and preferred media channels of the Savers segment to ensure that advertising efforts are effectively directed.

### Summary:

Allocating **80%** of the commercial team to the Savers segment alone was insufficient to address LOCK brand's low market share. This was the result of a combination of factors including product characteristics, low brand awareness, strong competition, and ineffective advertising. Moving forward, it is essential to invest in R&D for product improvement, enhance advertising efforts to increase brand awareness, and develop differentiation strategies through competitive analysis.

Here’s a detailed strategy for your new R&D project, with specific values, taking into account the needs of your target segments (Savers and High Earners) and the weaknesses identified in your current brands LOCK and LOOP. Additionally, the values have been adjusted to give you an advantage over your competitors.

### 1. **Features (# Features)**:
   - Currently, LOCK is targeted toward **Savers**, a segment that is more price-sensitive and focused on value rather than high-end features. The **High Earners** segment is more demanding, but excessive features may not be necessary here either.
   - **Recommended Value: 7** features. 
     - This gives enough functionality for **Savers** without overloading them with unnecessary features, while still providing **High Earners** with a competitive offering. Aiming for about 7 features strikes a good balance.

### 2. **Design (Design Index)**:
   - **Design** has been one of the weaker points for both LOCK and LOOP. **High Earners** expect a high design score, and **Savers** still care about aesthetics, though less so.
   - **Recommended Value: 6** (for both LOCK and LOOP).
     - A design improvement to **6** will make your brands stand out against competitors like **NOVA** and **ROCK**, who tend to focus on design but have left room for you to catch up. This improvement will also make your products more desirable to **Savers**, who prefer a modern look at a reasonable price.

### 3. **Battery (Battery Life in Hours)**:
   - Battery life is a crucial factor, especially for the **Savers** segment. Many competing products have stronger battery performance.
   - **Recommended Value: 40 hours**.
     - This increase from the current 24-hour battery life will significantly outperform competitors in the **Savers** segment, such as **SOFT** and **SOLO**, while also meeting the higher expectations of **High Earners**. Competitors like **ROCK** and **TONE** have been pushing for longer battery life, so this should give you an edge.

### 4. **Display (Size in Inches)**:
   - For **High Earners**, display size is a key factor. Competitors like **NOVA** have larger displays, which can give them an edge.
   - **Recommended Value: 5 inches**.
     - A 5-inch display is a strong step up from the current 4 inches and makes your product more competitive against brands like **NOVA** and **ROCK** in the **High Earners** segment. It’s also a manageable size for **Savers**, who appreciate practicality.

### 5. **Processing Power (GFLOPS)**:
   - Processing power is one of the weakest aspects of your brands compared to competitors targeting **High Earners**, like **NOVA** and **TONE**.
   - **Recommended Value: 15 GFLOPS**.
     - Increasing the processing power from the current 5 GFLOPS to **15 GFLOPS** will position you ahead of most competitors. It makes your product more appealing to **High Earners** and even sets you apart in the **Savers** segment by offering a higher-than-expected performance at a competitive price.

### 6. **R&D Budget**:
   - Considering the need to make substantial improvements across multiple dimensions, a **budget of at least $4,000K** should be allocated to this R&D project. This budget will allow you to focus on the critical improvements, primarily in design and processing power, with battery life and display size being secondary but still important aspects.

### 7. **Competitor Considerations**:
   - **Competitors like NOVA and ROCK** dominate the **High Earners** segment, with strong design and processing power. Increasing your brand’s **design** to **6** and **processing power** to **15 GFLOPS** ensures that you can compete with their flagship products.
   - In the **Savers** segment, **SOFT** and **SOLO** are offering solid battery performance. Your **40-hour battery life** and solid processing power of **15 GFLOPS** will ensure **LOCK** becomes a highly competitive product in this segment.

### Summary:
By adjusting these values, your brands will be better positioned to meet the evolving needs of your target segments and outpace the competition:
- **7 features** to satisfy both segments.
- **Design: 6** to appeal to both **Savers** and **High Earners**.
- **Battery: 40 hours** to give you a significant competitive edge, especially in the **Savers** segment.
- **Display: 5 inches**, hitting the sweet spot for **High Earners** and **Savers** alike.
- **Processing Power: 15 GFLOPS**, ensuring your products can handle the demands of **High Earners** and stand out in the **Savers** market.

This R&D focus should help significantly improve the competitiveness of both **LOCK** and **LOOP** in the coming period, ensuring growth in market share and value.



### in diesem Round targeting the ''**High Earners''** segment can be a risky strategy. 

### Particularly, given that competitors have already established a strong presence in this segment and the current situation involves an over-reliance on the **LOOP** brand, allocating additional resources to this market can further **increase risks**. Therefore, in this round, it is crucial to **adopt a balanced strategy** to diversify risks and strengthen weaker areas. Below are strategic proposals based on this approach:

This highlights the need for R&D to enhance **design**, **battery performance**, and **processing power**. The Savers segment has a growth potential of **123%**, making it highly attractive.
   - **Marketing and Commercial Team Allocation**: It is necessary to boost advertising for LOCK and appropriately redistribute the commercial team by shifting some personnel from the **Online Stores** to **Specialty Stores**. This will help increase LOCK's brand awareness and improve the ratio of purchase intention to awareness.

#### 2.2 **Shoppers Segment**
   - **Shoppers** have a very high growth rate of **28.8%**, making it important to expand market share in this segment.
   - Allocate some of the **LOOP** brand's resources to the Shoppers segment and expand the customer base across **various segments** through targeted advertising.

#### 2.3 **Profs Segment**
   - The **Profs segment** also has high sales and growth rates, so allocating some resources here should be considered. Emphasizing **advanced features** and **design** can be an effective strategy.

### 3. **R&D Strategy for Risk Diversification**
R&D is essential in this round. However, it should not only focus on improving products for the **High Earners** but also reflect the **needs of various segments**. Specifically, improvements to **LOCK** should target product characteristics that appeal to both **Savers** and **Shoppers** segments.

### Proposed R&D Improvements:

# Ist das Feedback des coach richtig?



Based on a comprehensive analysis of the feedback provided by the coach and the screenshots you sent, there are both alignments and discrepancies between some of the feedback and the decisions made. Below is a detailed examination of these findings:

### 1. **Feedback on LOCK (Focus on Savers Segment)**

According to the feedback, LOCK has been underperforming in the **Savers** segment. Specifically, LOCK has achieved a **13.6%** market share in the Savers segment, which is a **2.2%** decrease compared to the previous period.

However, the screenshot you provided shows that **LOCK has allocated a significant portion of its advertising budget to the Savers segment**, dedicating **80%** of the commercial team resources. This strategic decision was intended to bolster LOCK's presence in the Savers segment. Despite this high allocation, several factors may explain why this did not translate into increased market share:

- **Advertising Efficiency Issues**: Even with substantial advertising investment, LOCK's brand awareness in the Savers segment may still be low. As mentioned in the feedback, while the "Purchase Intentions ÷ Awareness" ratio is high, the **awareness level relative to purchase intent** remains insufficient.
  
- **Product Characteristics Misalignment**: The feedback indicated that LOCK's product features do not meet the expectations of the Savers segment.

3. **Focus on Shoppers Segment Growth**:
   - The Shoppers segment shows the highest growth rate and presents a substantial opportunity. Allocate additional resources to target this segment effectively, leveraging the existing growth potential to expand market share.

4. **Reallocate Commercial Team Resources**:
   - **LOCK**: Although 80% of the commercial team is allocated to the Savers segment, the focus has been too heavily on **Online Stores**. Since the Savers segment prefers purchasing from **offline stores**, it is necessary to **reallocate the commercial team** towards **Specialty Stores** to better target this segment.

5. **Balanced Marketing Budget Allocation**:
   - Ensure that LOOP’s marketing budget is not overly concentrated on the High Earners segment. Redirect a portion of the advertising and commercial team budget to effectively target the Shoppers segment, thereby balancing the focus across high-potential segments.

### **Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Invest in R&D for Product Improvement**:
